# iCE.terminal

Retro styled Terminal.app and iTerm2 color scheme profiles.

## About

I put together a terminal profile that works nice in many scenarios. It uses
a color palette that was common in the ANSi BBS days. Enjoy these retro colors
which will give you a bit of nostalgia which you can't find with the
contemporary terminal color schemes everyone seems to be pimpin' these days.

## Terminal.app and ZSH Integration

This profile is optimized for use with If you use ZSH take a look at my plug-in
which integrates your command-line with the GUI of the new El Capitan
[Terminal.app using customized status escape codes and Emoji.](https://github.com/the8/zsh-terminal-app-)
