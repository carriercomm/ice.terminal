Retro styled Terminal.app and iTerm2 color scheme profiles.

I put together a terminal profile that works nice in many scenarios. It uses
a color palette that was common in the ANSi BBS days. Enjoy these retro colors
which will give you a bit of nostalgia which you can't find with the contemporary
terminal color schemes everyone seems to be pimpin' these days.

## ZSH Integration

If you use ZSH take a look at my plug-in which integrates your shell with the
GUI of the new El Capitan [Terminal.app status escape codes.](https://github.com/the8/iCE-terminal)
